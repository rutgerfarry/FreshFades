‚ö†Ô∏è **ARCHIVED:** Since I've left Corvallis, as far as I know, Fresh Fades has shut down (you can check the status of their website [here](http://www.corvallisfreshfades.com)). Therefore, this project is archived and no longer being maintained.

FreshFades is a simple iOS app I'm making for my local barbershop in Corvallis, [Corvallis Fresh Fades](http://www.corvallisfreshfades.com/home). The main objective is to make it easy for customers to stay up to date with the barbershop and schedule appointments on their phone. 

Over the years I've developed some opinions on iOS development but haven't had a chance to showcase them beyond corporate firewalls. Now that I have a freelance project, I've decided to make it [open-source](http://code.dblock.org/2015/02/09/becoming-open-source-by-default.html) to show people how I like to do iOS development and hopefully gain feedback from the community. üíöüì±
